        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
        <p>One important issue in aquaculture industry currently experiencing is the lack of good quality of breeding stocks and insufficient to support breeding activity. Since the development of species costs are high, require a lot of ponds and large areas and also take a very long time to achieve. The farmers also usually use easily purchased parent breeding stocks from the clay ponds. Meanwhile, Farmers who sell breeding stocks sell good quality fish. Sometimes breeding farms use parent breeding stocks without any concern of the origin and growth characteristics. All these reasons are important issues of aquaculture industry.</p>
        <p>This project create an effective solution for breeding stock farmers by applying RFID technology to decrease breeding areas, and this management system was developed to each fish track automatically that help farmers to record fish weight and take a photo one by one. This system will help calculating the growth of each characteristic including weight, length, and other ratios by the economics important, evaluate heritability and recommend farmers to select good quality of breeding stocks.</p>
